1.1	Problem Statement: 
The hiring process is difficult because companies receive a large number of resumes for every job opening. Examining every résumé by hand requires a significant amount of time and work. Additionally, the fairness of hiring decisions may be impacted by the errors or prejudices of recruiters. This issue is significant because businesses want a method that is precise, fast, and equitable in order to choose the most qualified applicants for open positions. Hiring can be a long process without automation, and the best candidates might not always be chosen.
